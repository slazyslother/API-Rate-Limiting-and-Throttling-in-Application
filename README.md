# API Rate Limiting and Throttling in Application

This project involves implementing rate limiting in a C++ API to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage. Rate limiting restricts the number of requests a client can make within a specific time frame. Libraries or services like Redis will be used to manage rate limits. Additionally, monitoring and adjusting rate limits based on usage patterns will be implemented to optimize performance and ensure scalability.

## Features

- __Rate Limiting__: Implement mechanisms to restrict the number of requests per client within a defined time window.
- __Throttling__: Control the rate of incoming requests to prevent overload and ensure smooth operation of the API.
- __Redis Integration__: Utilize Redis as a data store to manage and enforce rate limits efficiently.
- __Dynamic Rate Adjustment__: Monitor API usage patterns and adjust rate limits dynamically to optimize performance and ensure fair usage.
- __Error Responses__: Provide informative error responses when rate limits are exceeded to guide clients on appropriate usage.

<br/>

## Utility Functions

- __Rate Limit Middleware__: Develop middleware to intercept incoming requests and enforce rate limits based on client identifiers (e.g., IP address, API key).
- __Redis Integration__: Integrate Redis client libraries (e.g., hiredis) to interact with Redis server for storing and retrieving rate limit data.
- __Usage Monitoring__: Implement mechanisms to monitor API usage patterns, such as request frequency and client behavior.
- __Dynamic Rate Adjustment__: Analyze usage metrics and adjust rate limits dynamically based on traffic patterns and system load.

## Implementation

- __Rate Limit Enforcement__: Implement middleware to intercept incoming requests and check against rate limits stored in Redis. Reject requests that exceed the defined limits with appropriate error responses.
- __Redis Integration__: Set up Redis as a data store to store rate limit information such as request counts and time windows. Use Redis commands for atomic operations to ensure thread safety and consistency.
- __Usage Monitoring__: Implement monitoring mechanisms to track API usage metrics, such as request rates and client identifiers. Store usage data in Redis or a dedicated monitoring system for analysis.
- __Dynamic Rate Adjustment__: Analyze usage patterns periodically and adjust rate limits dynamically based on observed traffic patterns and system load. Use feedback loops to fine-tune rate limits for optimal performance and fairness.

<br/>

## Testing

- __Unit Testing__: Write unit tests to verify the functionality of rate limit middleware, Redis integration, and dynamic rate adjustment algorithms.
- __Integration Testing__: Perform integration tests to ensure seamless interaction between components such as middleware, Redis, and usage monitoring mechanisms.
- __Load Testing__: Simulate a high volume of incoming requests to validate the effectiveness of rate limiting and throttling mechanisms under different load conditions.
- __Stress Testing__: Test the robustness and scalability of the system by subjecting it to extreme load and observing how it handles rate limits and adjusts dynamically.

<br/>

## Example Scenarios

- __Rate Limit Enforcement__: Simulate incoming requests with different client identifiers and verify that requests are accepted or rejected based on the configured rate limits.
- __Redis Integration__: Test interactions with Redis server for storing and retrieving rate limit data. Ensure that Redis commands are executed atomically to avoid race conditions.
- __Usage Monitoring__: Monitor API usage metrics such as request rates and client behavior. Analyze usage data to identify patterns and trends.
- __Dynamic Rate Adjustment__: Adjust rate limits dynamically based on observed usage patterns and system load. Validate that rate adjustments are effective in maintaining performance and fairness.
